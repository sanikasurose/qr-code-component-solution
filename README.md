# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

## Overview

This is my first challenge with Frontend Mentor!

### What I learned

Despite knowing just the basics of CSS and HTML, I was confident going into this challenge. I very quickly realized it was much harder than it looked, and had to go back and review div positioning often. By the end, I was proud of what I had come up with.

### Continued development

In the future I will definitely continue to work on positioning, it is one of the most confusing concepts I have come across yet.
